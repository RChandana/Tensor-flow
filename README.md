# TensorFlow

TensorFlow is an open source machine learning framework. 
It is used for implementing machine learning and deep learning applications.
TensorFlow is designed in Python programming language, hence it is considered an easy to understand framework.



### :star: Important features of TensorFlow −


- It includes a feature of that defines, optimizes and calculates mathematical expressions easily with the help of multi-dimensional arrays called tensors.

- It includes a programming support of deep neural networks and machine learning techniques.

- It includes a high scalable feature of computation with various data sets.

- TensorFlow uses GPU computing, automating management. It also includes a unique feature of optimization of same memory and the data used.

- TensorFlow can train and run deep neural networks for handwritten digit classification, image recognition, word embedding and creation of various sequence models.

- It is easily trainable on CPU as well as GPU for distributed computing.

- TensorFlow offers pipelining in the sense that you can train multiple neural networks and multiple GPUs which makes the models very efficient on large-scale         systems.

TensorFlow is well-documented and includes plenty of machine learning libraries. It offers a few important functionalities and methods for the same.

TensorFlow is also called a “Google” product. It includes a variety of machine learning and deep learning algorithms. TensorFlow can train and run deep neural networks for handwritten digit classification, image recognition, word embedding and creation of various sequence models.


## Pros:-
### Graphs
 Tensorflow has better computational graph visualizations, which are indigenous when compared to other libraries like 
 Torch and Theano.

### Library Management
  Backed by Google, TensorFlow has the advantage of seamless performance, quick updates and frequent new 
  releases with new features.
  
### Debugging
 Tensorflow lets you execute subparts of a graph which gives it an upper hand as you can introduce and retrieve discrete 
 data onto an edge and therefore offers a great debugging method.  

### Scalability
 The libraries can be deployed on a gamut of hardware machines, starting from cellular devices to computers with 
 complex setups.

### Pipelining
 TensorFlow is highly parallel and designed to use various backends software (GPU, ASIC) etc.
