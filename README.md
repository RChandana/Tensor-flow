# TensorFlow

TensorFlow is an open source machine learning framework. 
It is used for implementing machine learning and deep learning applications.
TensorFlow is designed in Python programming language, hence it is considered an easy to understand framework.


Important features of TensorFlow âˆ’

It includes a feature of that defines, optimizes and calculates mathematical expressions easily with the help of multi-dimensional arrays called tensors.

It includes a programming support of deep neural networks and machine learning techniques.

It includes a high scalable feature of computation with various data sets.

TensorFlow uses GPU computing, automating management. It also includes a unique feature of optimization of same memory and the data used.
